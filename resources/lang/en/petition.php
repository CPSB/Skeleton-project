A number of dangerous incidents have already occurred in the Baltic Sea region, in Ukraine and Syria.',
    'text_4' => 'The danger is extremely grave because of nuclear proliferation. Since we no longer want to endanger humanity, the costly modernisation of the nuclear arsenal will be stopped. These weapons of mass destruction will be dismantled. We invite other nuclear powers to do likewise in an atmosphere of trust.
